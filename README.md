# FOODGO – Mobile Food Delivery App UI

## Project Overview
FOODGO is a mobile food delivery application UI designed as part of a Week Two UI/UX assignment.  
The project focuses on clean visual design, usability, consistency, and simple user flow.

## Screens Designed
- Home / Food Discovery Screen
- Food Details Screen
- Cart Screen
- Checkout Screen
- Order Success Screen

## Tools Used
- Figma (UI Design & Prototyping)
- PNG assets for screen export

## UX Rationale
The interface follows a familiar food-delivery flow to reduce user friction.  
Card-based layouts, clear call-to-action buttons, and consistent spacing improve usability.  
Micro-interactions and smooth navigation enhance the overall user experience.
